# Web editing as typography

---

## Ch. 1 of the textbook

- creating pages in the way printshop create books

- can we take an arbitrary text and make it look good in print?
  
- boilerplates: a fixed typographic structure that is applied to provide conformity and readability

---

## Visual experience

Please look at Ch.1 of the textbook

---

## try yourself

- Open the [change-me.html](./change-me.html) file with a browser

- Now open it with [Notepad]() or a similar editor

- try out some change to the text, save the file then *reload* on the browser

---

## Technical points

- the interpretation approach

- the importance of browsers today

- the need for a formal language to describe a visual experience
