## Data collection and privacy issues

Leave Ethical considerations aside to examine what can be technically collected and how to avoid it

Currently, it is believed that Google et al. collect

- geographical location
- IP address
- usage of Google services: YT, Gmail, Gmaps...
- which ads one clicks and their location on the page
- device information
- Server information
- more identifying info. from "partner" services

---

all such data may be used for targeted/re-targeted *ad placement* and *search relevancy*

Data can be purchased by third-parties via

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision).

- [FB for business/CrowdTangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com/)

## Third-party trackers

According to the [EFF foundation](https://www.eff.org/):

*"When you visit a webpage parts of the page may come from domains and servers other than the one you asked to visit*

*This is an essential feature of hypertext*

*On the modern Web, embedded images and code often use cookies and other methods to track your browsing habits — often to display advertisements*

*The domains that do this are called [third party trackers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/online-trackers-and-social-networks)"*


---

## `I don't have anything to hide`

customer profiling and tracking is never neutral and hardly positive

While it promises to customise advertisement so that it's relevant to the user, the fact that such data exists is dangerous in itself and invites abuse

Recommended approach: use photos of [AI-generated non-persons](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)

---

## End-to-end encryption

Becoming a standard today, it purports to eliminate *eavesdropping* and *impersonation.*

In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)

---

## Encryption, cont'd

Seen as an extension of mail privacy rights, it does much more

It is based on notions of Number theory (requires finding the prime factors of large integers)

decryption takes practically forever

---

## no exchange of secrets

Each participant will have a pair of keys: one public and one private not for sharing

Its development provides the basis of crypto-currencies

While probably based on a *paranoid* vision of liberal societies, E2E encryption helps in many instances

---

## Incognito pages

browsers will allow navigation without saving any cookies or history

Only good to avoid parental/corporate control: today most web services track the IP number of the device

---

## Case study

Visit [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/11/27/adventure-capitalism)

from different browsers of the same computer, even in incognito mode.

Explore the source code, with `ctrl+u`: can you see the content?

Compare with the access restrictions on [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)


---

## Containers

limit the ability of some site, eg Facebook, to track: 

the *like* and *follow* buttons embedded elsewhere can create user tracking well beyond the visit to FB's own page

FB might even track you visiting pages you don't *like* nor *share*

It is unclear whether one can 100% avoid FB tracking

A recommended solution is [multi-account containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)


---

## non-Chrome browser

Chrome is built around an excellent *page rendering software*

The extra is basically tracking your navigation to see where you goo when you __jump out__ of site:

this is the only part of navigation that the server-side cannot see

Google releases (at least for now) the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) version of Chrome, which is lighter and less tracking

*Use Chromium*

---

## Example research on Web

The [Potential Gain model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3350546.3352559) rates  the most central, (i.e., influential) pages when accounting for the "jumps" in human web navigation

*We say that a network N is navigable when an agent is able to efficiently reach any target node in N by means of local routing decisions*

*In a social network navigability translates to the ability of reaching an individual through personal contacts*

---

## Potential gain, cont'd

*Graph navigability is well-studied, but a fundamental question is still open:*

*why some people more likely than others to be reached via short, friend-of-a-friend, communication chains?*

*We propose [a model of human navigation on networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025523007867) that explains this phenomenon*

## non-Google search

Don't log into Google services unless you have to. (I have to)

Use the [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/settings) aggregator for your searches

[Ad blocker is subsumed by Privacy badger]


---

## Privacy Badger

Probably the best overall solution now available, the [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) browser extension disable tracking cookies, supercookies etc.

"If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.
To the advertiser, it’s like you suddenly disappeared."


---

## The Ad Observer

An academic [project](https://adobserver.org/) developed by the [NYU Cybersecurity fo Democracy project](https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/) which is now under heavy legal fire from Facebook etc.: the ultimate endorsement in terms of creating web privacy.

The idea: collect and make public what information and what advertisements are served up by FB, Google etc. and to which (broad) audience.

Currently focussed on [US politics ads on FB](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-ad-collector/)


---

## The [Ad nauseam](https://adnauseam.io/)

*Another browser add-on that addresses profiling, but in a *starkly different way*:

instead of denying access to the cliks and likes, they __spoil__ the signal coming from our web activity to the __[maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))__ (minimum information content).
