# Recap

---

## Concepts, a

We began to study the formal languages by which Web pages are created

- HTML: text + settings (invisible) + *mark up* tags
  
- CSS: the style associated to tags

Open the HTML file into a browser to see the final effect

---

## Concepts, b

Creativity is mediated by *strict rules* of the languages: apart from spaces, all characters and punctation matter!

we must learn the basics of HTML and CSS

Browsers interpret our commands and serve a *rendering* of the page

---

## Skills, a

- work with the *file system* of our computer: positioning of files inside folders matter

- get code/software projects from Github

- install *softare installers:* Chocolatey or HomeBrew 
  
- use them to install further software:

  - *VS Code,* and its extensions, for editing files

  - *Git,* to synchronise the class materials from Github

Not stricly needed but they help *local* learning

---

## Skills, b

On [https://wdpg.io](https://wdpg.io) we did

- 1.1 and 1.2 to get started with HTML+CSS and rendering

- 2.1 to 2.8 to learn the basic mark-up tags, e.g., `p`, `b`, `em`...

## The Lorem exercise

- take the boilerplate project inside `learn-web/15-lorem-boilerplate`

- select file `rename-then-edit-me.html`, right-click then rename it. E.g., `ale-lorem.html` 

- select file `mystyle.css`, right-click then rename it. E.g., `ale-style.css` 

Alternatively, you can copy the two files and put them into any folder, e.g., `Downloads`, that sits outside  `learn-web `

Think of an intended reader of your page. E.g. 

- High-school students of Latin 

- teachers who are looking for classroom examples

- turists of Rome who get curious about great Latin literature 

- adults who are reading Cicero for the pleasure of his Latin prose

write HTML/CSS to create a suitable style

it should deploy all concepts learnt in WDPG 2.1--2.8

Later, include concepts from WDPG 2.9 & 2.10
