## Review: the DOM representation

[Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).

![](./images/html-requires-js.jpg)


---

#### Conceptual framework

We see the page as a top-down, left-to-right structure

Browsers represent it internally as a tree.

which grows from left to right.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/DOM-model.svg)


---


Each element of the tree is a node with a specific name

Each node is an *object* with name, content, properties and *methods* for changing it

---

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/DOM-model.svg)

- *DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree*

- *with them, one can change the structure, style or content of a document*

---


# Example

---

An image is shown in the page, right above a button

If the user presses the button, an internal Javascript code is executed

The code alters the leaf of the DOM tree that contains the name of the file containing the image

A different image is now shown

```html
<img id="myImage" src=".mypicture.jpg" width="200" alt="An image">

<p>
  <button type="button" onclick="myFunc('summer')">Verano</button>
  ...
```

Button come with a *listener:* ``onclick`` is an event: 

see [the complete list](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp) of events.


---

## Observations

* ``myImage`` should be a unique identifier
  
* ``mypicture.jpg`` must be linked properly wrt. the position of the HTML file

* ``myFunc()`` is a function we defined in a ``<script>`` element or in a separate ``.js`` file

* it is called with a parameter which is a string ``myFunc('summer')``

if any of this is not set up properly then the browser won't execute the behavior we want
