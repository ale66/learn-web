## Installations

For a quick start, use the online VS Code tool [https://vscode.dev/](https://vscode.dev/)

For better learning setup your computer to work on a local folder with HTML, CSS and other files

Several new softwares and settings mush be applied to your laptop

This presentation relates to Win 10 laptops. 

For Win 11: authorise installations. 

---

## Installation with `admin` 

Installations typically require *admin* access.

Win: start the ``Windows PowerShell`` app by finding it with the magnifyng lens then right-clik and select 'Run as admin'

donloading+installing may require time. 

---

## [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

<img src="./images/choco.jpg" height="120">

It manages installed software as linux does: the whole platform can be updated at a stroke

Intallation is slightly complex, see [here](https://chocolatey.org/install)

---

## [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

it simplifies installing/upgrading apps

Example: I want the Chromium browser, which is less nosy than Chrome

1. Start a Windows __PowerShell__ in administrator mode 
  
2. type:

```bash
> choco install chromium
```

## VS Code

Free and light, it supports coding in many ways

```bash
> choco install vscode
```

However, it requires [lots of] extensions, to be loaded in-app

# Installing Git

<img src="./images/gitlogo.png" height="60">

- a protocol for managing code (web pages *are* code) 

- keeps track of our work so it can undo changes that disrupt previous work

- collaboration is supported so teams can work asynchronously

- branching allows to explore new ideas without spoiling the existing code

[Github]() is a community repository for sharing code and open collaborations

[download the Git app](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

to maintain your copy of the GH repo [github.com/ale66/learn-web](https://github.com/ale66/learn-web) up-to-date

General tendence: code is public but data is very private

# MacOs

Thanks to the underlying `unix`, it supports developers well

See instructions for Win and 

- use the *Terminal* app instead of *PowerShell*

- to run admin commands inside Terminal type `> sudo su`

then enter the computer's password (not your own).
End the admin session with `> exit`

Some commands differ: to see the local files Win uses `>dir` while MacOs uses `>ls -lrt`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Git implements incremental/differential synchronisation

it's easy to synchronise your local copy of a repo with the Github version

- first time: clone existing repository into a suitable folder

```bash
>git clone https://github.com/ale66/learn-coding.git
```

- updating: from a terminal working on the repository folder (or below)

```bash
>git pull
```

## [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
=======
## [Home Brew](https://brew.sh/)
>>>>>>> 103141406c8962dbbe966dc113237fe8f59b65ef

Essentially the same as Chocolatey, but for MacOS.

```bash
> brew --cask install visual-studio-code
```
