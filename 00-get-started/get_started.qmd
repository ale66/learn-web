## Learning objectives

* formal learning: coding authonomy with hypertext, markup, interpretation, boilerplates, web linking, containers etc.

* informal learning: plan, design and implement *a web communication project;* create a mock and present it to a technical/business committee

---

### Posponed gratification

* working in COM today often involves joining a web/multimedia team

* teams with *front-end* (UX) and *back-end* figures

* as with all technical communities, a jargon and unspoke assumptions

* technology is often unnecessarily obscure and

* continously changing  

---

##### Webcomm enables you to 

* navigate
    
    * a complex jargon
    
    * new languages, new development tools, new delivery mechanisms

* communicate with _techies_ effectively

* articulate what you want

* come up with your own concepts (mock-ups)

* if Web page design is your thing, a reasonable shot at getting *junior front-end developer* positions


# The exam

## Critical assessment

- to go from vision to industry we need concrete *sketches* or *artifacts*

- current pages are created only by the execution of complex Javascript (JS) codes: this is left for advanced training
  
- customer profiling/monitoring begins right at code level: let's see how

- implementation autonomy relieves us from dependence on social web platforms
