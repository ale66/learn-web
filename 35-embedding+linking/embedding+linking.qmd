# Embedding


---

## The digital page, so far

- a HTML file with the structure
  
- a CSS file with the styles

- images as files (local or online)

Browsers will read the HTML, yank the needed parts and combine them to render the final page

However, we are responsible for preparing the files and *linking* them up.


## Advancements

- personalised CSS styles make pages come alive and create the *visuals*

- Even though embedding style into HTML is permitted, we keep them segregated on the CSS

- *hero* background images (with *tiling*)

- on-image titles, but need well-designed fonts

---


## In-class project

Goal: an info page for MA COM that looks attractive

Stage 1: hero image with title and some info text below

Stage 2 (now): restyle the the info text with better fonts, colors and the unimi seal in the background

---


Stage 3 (later): add motivating images, e.g., pictures of group work, friendly students, friendly academics etc.

Example: pages from R. Quenau's works to underline the visual element of reading/communicating

![](./imgs/quenau-page-1.jpg){width=40%} 
![](./imgs/quenau-page-2.jpg){width=40%}

```html
<img src="./imgs/quenau-page-2.jpg" alt="" title="">
```


# Linking


## Linearity

Printed material is normally for reading from start to finish

The table of contents allows *skipping ahead* on some parts

In textbooks, numbered definitions, figures and formulae allow mentioning them in the text and also go back to revise content.

Bibliographic references *integrate* the material and support different level of reading


---

## Non-linearity

Narratives might not follow the exact time sequence

HTML supports the *hypertext:*

- parts of the text are connected to arbitrary texts, be them parts of the same text (backward or forward) or external sources

- users can follow up the links and continue reading there (or come back)
  
- virtually infinite reading patterns are possible


--

## The anchor

```html
 <a href="https://www.unimi.it/">Visit our uni!</a> 
```

[Visit our uni!](https://www.unimi.it/)

CSS will program the graphics of the linked text

By clicking we 'get there:' browsers acquire the new page, build up and serve it

---

## Visit vs. reference

```html
 <a href="https://www.unimi.it/" target="_blank">Visit our uni!</a> 
```

Opens in a separated tab


---

Same syntax for internal and external reference

```html
<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>
```

Local files are searched from the local folder, as with CSS:


```html
<a href="./notes/october24.html">my local notes</a>
```


---

## But were are we going, exactly?

```html
<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>
```

- The ``https`` protocol assigns a computer (server) of reference for [www.w3.org]

- on that computer, local software serves https requests and has a special folder, called *root* where it stores public files (HMTL, CSS etc.)

- unless the link specifies a file, ``index.html`` will be served: ``www.w3.org/`` is equivalent to ``www.w3.org/index.html``


---

## Linked images

Embed the image inside the anchor

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Velasca">
  <img src="./imgs/torrevelasca.jpg" alt="a tower" height="200px">
</a> 
```

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Velasca">
<img src="./imgs/torrevelasca.jpg" alt="link on this photo" height="200px">
</a> 


---

## Exercise

You know better than anyone what are the relevant sites/services for a perspective MA COM student

Link them from the page, possibly with thumbnails (small previews)


# Complex embeddingns

Audio/Video embedding is done with a third-party software that browers *inject* in the page

Maps are treated similarly

## Embed Video, a

```html
<video src = "file"
  poster   = "title image"
  width    = "value"
  height   = "value"
  controls 
  loop>
</video>
```

Pro: we have control of what to play

Con: very brittle

---

## Enbed video, b

```html
<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://youtu.be/embed/SXOPmxqShRU?si=hMqSR4PGQNuEcLNR">
</iframe>
```

Pro: works well

Con: as with online images, we lease control of some parts of our page.


---

## Embed Audio

A special case of Video, today almost always disallowed

```html
<audio 
  controls 
  autoplay>
    <source src="./multimedia/example-bootleg.opus" type="audio/opus">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

<audio 
  controls 
  autoplay>
    <source src="./audio+video/example-bootleg.opus" type="audio/opus">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>


# Exercise

Embed a clickable YT video of our MA COM:
