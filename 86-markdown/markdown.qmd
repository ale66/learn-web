# Markdown

---

## Mark-up, a recap

Enrich the text with annotations that may describe 

- its structure: `<body>`, `<header>`, `<p>` ...

- how it should be rendered: `<h1>`, `<b>` ... 

- the meaning of its parts: `<title>`, `<quote>` `<article>` ...  

. . .

Residual cases:

- tags inside `<head>` for indexing etc., in particular `<meta>`

- tages inside `<body>`: `<div>` and `<span>`


---

## Currently

- we are editing HTML documents to provide a bit of all this
  
- the text is irremediably mixed with the mark-up

- the mark-up is not very readable and often repetitive


---

## The Markdown vision

1. prepare a text file with all the content but only minimal annotations: the Markdown file `my_contents.md`

2. feed it to a *parser* software, e.g., *pandoc* that *renders* it: 

   - HTML tags are *injected* into the file, and 
  
   - CSS styles are linked and assigned to tags
  
3. the thus-created `my_page.html` can be manually refined/tweaked, if need be

4. publish it

---

## The ubiquity of Markdown

The process above is oftern called *rendering* of contents

today large platforms with web page generation support Markdown contenct and render them automatically:

- MyAriel

- GitHub

Advantages:

- less error-prone than HTML

- fragments (as opposed to a complete page) can be easily integrated

- uniform page appearance


1.  in the `my_page.html` version:

- fixed parts, e.g., `<body>...</body>` are automatically incorporated

- annotations are interpreted and incorporated:

    - `# Big title` --> `<h1>Big title</h1>`
  
    - `__boldface__` --> `<b>boldface</b>` and so on


---

## two meanings for `[]()`


`[linked text](https://www.unimi.it)` --> 

. . .

`<a href='https://www.unimi.it'>linked text</a>`

. . .

`![](./imgs/image.png)` --> 

. . .

`<img src='./imgs/image.png'>`


---

MD files are essentially parsed and rendered row by row

it is possible to put HTML tags into a MD file and to see them in the rendering.

```html
### this is an h3 title in MD

<img src='./imgs/image.png' width="50%" alt='Merry Xmas'>

__this is a boldface caption to the image__
```

---

## MD interpreters

- download the MD extension for VS Code

- use online interpreters from GitHub

## The limits of MD

There is no internation/industrial standard:

ambiguity ensues

`![My text](./imgs/image.png)` --> 

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```html
<img src='./imgs/image.png' alt="My text">
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```html
<img src='./imgs/image.png'>

<h6>My text</h6>
```
:::
::::

Use Pandoc/Quarto Markdown


# Learn MD


---

## Get started 

Study the simplified language on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) where interpretation is automated

GitHub interprets Markdown automatically

Example: [collapsed sections](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections)


---

## Mardown in VS Code

VS code supplies a preview of the rendering of `.md` files

install the [Markdown-all-in-one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension by Yu Zhang

The page explains how to code MD quickly
