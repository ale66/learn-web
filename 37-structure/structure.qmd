# Structure


---

## Important properties

Whereas rendered pages are normally related to a linear, left-to-right, top-down reading, browsers see pages as *trees*

Biological tree: one *root* element at the bottom which splits up repeatedly in smaller and smaller branches; leaves at the top


---

HTML tree: flipped upside down

a single root element at the top

branching out into several smaller elements, some of which are siblings


---

## Parsing

Automated reading of a formal (code) file with *recognition* of the commands

HTML branch tags must be strictly contained into their *root*

are mistyping can throw the automated parsing off track


---


```html
<!doctype html>
```

This is not strictly HTML and it is read by the OS under the browser

---

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
</html>


---

One root, two branches

```html
<!doctype html>

<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

This part is mandatory

---

```html
<!doctype html>

<html>
  <head>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Text</p>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

One root, two branches and two leaves


---

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p>More text</p>
    <p>Another text</p>
    <p>Further text</p>
    ...
</head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Several leaves

---

Browsers process tags as *paths* from root to leaf:

```html
<html><head><h1>Title</h1>
```

```html
<html><head><p>Text</p>
```


Each leaf, or *unit of text* will be uniquely identified

Next, all the needed CSS command will be picked up from the CSS file and attached to the element
