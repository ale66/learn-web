 ``[...] society wants to sleep.`` 
  
  [[Guy Debord, La société du spectacle, 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle)]


- __users want to sleep__

- we need some standard style that best deliver the values underlying the content.

## The Flexbox

* a set of CSS styles that create a new standard page organization.

* to summarise: a landing page, with semantic tages but also *responsive*

## Learn the 'Flex'

Go over the only exercises:

- [wdpg.io/12-1-0](https://webdesignplayground.io/lessons/12-1-0/)

- [wdpg.io/12-2-0](https://webdesignplayground.io/lessons/12-1-0/)

- [wdpg.io/12-3-0](https://webdesignplayground.io/lessons/12-1-0/)

The latter shows a basic *plumbing* of a flex Web page: see the boilerplate in this section

For reference: read Ch. 12 of the textbook
