## Programme: 

* put down a quick Markdown presentation

* insert links and images

* create slides with pandoc

* publish on accessible web page (e.g., W3schools spaces)

* go to the meeting and present it

* let others catch up by reading on the web site


---

##  Commands

Pandoc is __a professional tool__ and needs Powershell (Win) or Terminal (MacOs) to be launched

The following instructions for Win can be applied almost verbatim to MacOs


---

## Commands: Win11

1. open the folder where the Markdown presentation file is, or where you want it to be.

2. right-click and start a `Terminal` or a `Powershell`

3. notice: you can also start a terminal/powershell from the 'Start' menu, but in such case you need the terminal to be 'pointed' to the working folder

If not we need to `cd` to the right directory, e.g.,

```bash
cd C:\Users\aless\git\96-revealjs
```

where the *path* is obviously personal


# From MD to Web presentation


---

## Run pandoc

```bash
pandoc --standalone --from markdown --to revealjs my_pres.md -o my_pres.html
```

Pandoc reads `my_pres.md` and creates a *standalone* (no auxiliary files) HTML page: 

`my_pres.html` will contain [lots of] JS code that is *injected* to create navigation, focus, pens etc. 


---

## Themes and animations

```bash
pandoc --standalone --from markdown --to revealjs my_pre.md -o my_pres.html -V transition=convex -V theme=solarized --verbose
```

Check the available options on [slides.com](www.slides.com) 

#### with CSS

```bash
pandoc --standalone --from markdown --to revealjs my_pre.md -o my_pres.html 
--css my_revealjs_style.css -V transition=convex -V theme=solarized --verbose
```



---

## Exercise

For page numbers, open your HTML presentation and add, towards the bottom:

```js
Reveal.initialize({
	slideNumber: 'c/t'
	});
```

Save and reload in a browser: voil&agrave;!

## Post activities

1. study the produced HTML file: what does it link to? Can we edit it?

2. Visit the project [GitHub page](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown) for updates.

3. Look at image embeddings such as the Revealjs logo in this presentation

4. can you use pandoc to create a PDF of your presentation? 
(could you write your MA thesis in Markdown?)
