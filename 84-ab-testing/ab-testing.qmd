# A/B testing


---

A/B testing, also called *clinical trial,* is a canonical procedure 

it can *reject* the null hypotheses thus corroborating a causality hypothesis

We will collect opinions on the basis of the interaction given by the page itself.


---

## The Method

1. Classically: divide the sample into two. On the Web: random-assign visitors to groups A and B.

2. To group A give a *stimulus* such as an announcement, or a discount or a new color schema.

3. Collect a *feedback* such as the clicking of a button.

4. compare the stats about group A and group B: which one reacted most?

---

#### Example

---

## Stats background, 1

What if the imbalance in reaction is accidental?

To answer we need to deploy *Statistical Hypothesis testing* to evaluate the impact a different interaction makes.

---

## Stats background, 2

If the recorded imbalance had probability to occur below 5pc

then we reject the *null hypothesis* the imbalance ain't just a fluctuation:

Hence, we may approve the *stimulus* as effective

## Implementing A/B testing

As the current Replit is not linking files, we rely on a version from last year.

## Randomised display

Cover the w3school lecture on [display](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.php)

__Challenge:__ can you think of an A/B test that uses diplay to get the differential feedback about a new feature which is shown (or not)

---

## Idea for a solution

* use the abTest function to select some visitor

* for group A, write a JS function which 'switches' the ``display`` of some part of the text, i.e., from

```js
p.classA {display: none;}

p.classB {display: block;}
```
