# Page layouts

## So far

we learnt how to combine `HTML5+CSS` to obtain pleasing *static* pages.

However, the default HTML layout is almost never a good idea...

- blocks and padding help in separating text and make it stand out, but
  
- the CSS style may result in displaying over two lines

## Lab

Import into your info page for Com the tags needed for the *holy grail* layout

Change your page accordingly, e.g., by moving the links to the `<nav>` part

Put the text that we retrieved from the official COM page into an article 

Make a new article by lifting text from the respective [CeS page](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/bachelor/communication-and-society-ces)

combine the articles in a more general page about 'Study communications at unimi'
