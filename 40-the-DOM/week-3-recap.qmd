# Recap

---

## Concepts, a

HTTP is the industrial protocol that underpins *the Web* as we know it 

client-server architecture: server is idle until client starts requests

browsers serve `<a>` tags and follow all linked resources (CSS files, images etc.)

files are copied locally

stateless: no *conversation* (introduced later)

---

## Concepts, b

Pages with multiple, external CSSs

Exercise: apply a fav CSS from *the garden* to your Lorem page 

To see effects, we need to use the same tags as their original HTML

Syntax and order of the links in `<head>` are crucial

---

## Concepts, c

Graphics/AV sources are *embeddable*

via `<img>` tags any source file, anywhere, can be embedded

Also, embeddable code for Google Maps and YouTube etc.

---

## Concepts, d

The *Hero Image* concept and its execution:

Embedding via specific CSS set ups that *fix* the hero 

Text-on-image special fonts and colours

Exercise: embed Cicero's images on your Lorem page
