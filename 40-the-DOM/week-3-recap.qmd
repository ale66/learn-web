# Recap

---

## Concepts, a

The HTML baseline code (aka boilerplate) read out and commented line-by-line

Still curious about `<head>`

---

## Concepts, b

Some default tags support styling text.

While HTML is built for *pages* we are now focuse on documents that are digital-only: no (or not necessarily) left-to-right top-down

---

## Concepts, c

Style: all in a separate file please

Styling is a separated activity, CSS files are often re-used

---

## Concepts, d


The `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="#label">go down on this page</a>
...
<div id="label">...
```

. . .

```html
<a href="./another_page.html">go to another page of the same site</a>
```

. . .

```html
<a href="https://unimi.it/ma/com/">go to a web site</a>
```

. . .

```html
<a href="https://unimi.it/ma/com/exams.html">go to a page on a web site</a>
```

. . . 

```html
<a href="https://unimi.it/ma/com/index.html#label">go to a specifi position of an external page</a>
```

---

## Concepts, e

The `<div>` tag:

divides text or areas of the page

it's a semantic tag: what it does will be coded by us

Example: style the first para. differently

```html
<div id="first">...</div>
<div id="regular">...</div>
```

---

## Skills, a

- VS Code and extensions running on computer to edit HTML/CSS files
  
---

## Skills, b

- git to synchronise with the class Github repository:

Get started, get a local copy:

```bash
>git clone https://github.com/ale66/learn-coding.git
```

Synch the material daily (or weekly)

```bash
>git pull
```

this is all for the moment!
