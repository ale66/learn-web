# Visuals


---

## The digital page, so far

- a HTML file on our computer
  
- beside, a CSS file with custom styles

- the page is *ditigal* but static, unconnected

---

## CSS styles

Even though style settings can go almost anywhere in HTML pages, we keep them *segregated* in CSS files.

This line must be inside the `<head>` part:


```html
  <link href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

In this case `mystyle.css` must be in the same folder as the HTML file.

---

## Case: the CSS file is in a different folder 

In a sub-folder:

```html
  <link href="./css/mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

In the folder above:

```html
  <link href="../mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

in a parallel folder:

```html
  <link href="../css/general_site_style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

---

## Case: there are several styles

```html
  <link href="../css/general_site_style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

  <link href="./css/specific_section_style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

Cascading effect: 

if both define an element of style, e.g. `font-color`, then the setup in the latter *wins* 


---

## Case: the style file is somewhere else in the file system

```html
<link href="c:/path/to/the/css/folder/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

---

## Case: the style file is online

We *borrow* the style from an online resource

```html
<link href="https://csszengarden.com/examples/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

Get styles are on [GitHub](https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com)


# Exercise

## Work with csszengarden styles

Can we import sophisticated styles into our pages?

Try out a version of your Lorem Lipsum page with Zengarden looks

Study the CSS to see what's available then use the styleLet's try simple styles, e.g. *Verde Moderna* or *Tranquille*

---

- visit [https://csszengarden.com/pages/alldesigns/](https://csszengarden.com/pages/alldesigns/)

- select a simple style
  
- look at the HTML source then at the CSS file to understand how it works 
  
- now link the style into your Lorem page to see the transformations

  - download the CSS, put it local to your Lipsum page the from the `head` section link the new style

  - from the HTML link the style on the Web (e.g., Github)


---

Get all the styles at once from [github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com
](https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com)

```bash
>git clone https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com.git
```

Challenge: you can clone directly from VS Code, thanks to the Git extension


# Images

## Including images

![](./imgs/raymond-quenau-page.jpg)

Browsers pick up image files and incorporate them in the rendering of the page

The HTML code will link image files in the same way as it links to the CSS file

The `<img>` tag has parameters that control the exact rendering of the image

```html
<img src="./imgs/quenau-page-1.jpg" alt="I show when the file fails to load" title="show when mouse over">
```

Notice: there is no `</img>`

## Online image embedding

```html
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Logo_Universit%C3%A0_degli_Studi_di_Milano.svg/1024px-Logo_Universit%C3%A0_degli_Studi_di_Milano.svg.png" alt="The unimi Minerva">
```

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Logo_Universit%C3%A0_degli_Studi_di_Milano.svg/1024px-Logo_Universit%C3%A0_degli_Studi_di_Milano.svg.png" alt="The unimi Minerva">

Try embedding the Uni logo in your Lorem page

Warning: we are *leasing* an area of the page to the source site

---

## a Brief on formats

- photo-oriented: they describe a *bitmap*: `.bmp`, `.jpg` and `.png`

- animation-oriented: `.gif`
    
- rendering oriented, total control: they contain code that creates the image in the context: `.svg`


---

## Figures

Different from simple embeddings, figures may have numbering, caption and be treated uniformly with the `<figure></figure>` tag

## Images as decor

- an image can become the background of the page or portions thereof

- with *tiling* the same pattern/logo can be repeated throghout arbitrary surfaces
  
- details in Ch. 6 of the textbook


# Custom styles

## Motivations

CSS definitions can customise the standard HTML tags

However, there are few of those and CSS will change all its instances at once

Example

```css
p {
  align: right;
}
```

aligns the whole document to the right...


---

## Visual classes

Create ad hoc styles via new classes

Each class name needs be unique and begin by `.`

```css
p {
  text-indent: 12pt;

  align: left;
}

.latinpara {
  text-indent: 4pt;

  align: right;
}
```


---

```html
<p>This is a presentation of an ancient text. Its author is Cicero.</p>

<p class="latinpara">Lorem ipsum ... </p>
```

---

## Draft new styles

Go to the Web Design Playground:

# The *hero image*

## An inviting visuals

Static pages now tend to start with a graphical upper part which is repeated for all pages: the *hero image*

---

![](./imgs/6-hero.png)

---

For hero images, and only for them, it makes sense to have a specific form of title, which is attuned to the image itself, e.g., matches its second or third color, has specific font etc.

![](./imgs/6-hero.png)

---

The CSS file can accomodate an hero image layout by 

- specific classes
  
- the `background` attribute to a class

---
