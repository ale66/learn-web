## Concepts, c

Javascript functions can change all aspects of the page at runtime

Two ways to embed JS into HTML:

- a: direct embedding

```html
<div>
  <script>console.log("I'm at the beginning of Ch. 4. Users won't see this message")</script>

  <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
  ...
</div>
```

---

- b: *listeners* capture user behaviour and launch JS functions to react

```html
 <button type="button" onclick="changeSeason('summer')">Verano</button>
```

we define the JS function in a separated file, e.g., `./scripts/myfunctions.js`

Event `onclick` is one of an handful of event types that can be listened to, e.g. `dblclick`, `mouseover`...

Listeners can be added dynamically:

```js
element.addEventListener('submit', function() {console.log('the form has been submitted')
                        });
```

## Concepts, d

Javascript allows iteration over collections of values, called lists
