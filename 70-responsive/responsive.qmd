# Responsive


---

## So far

A page is *responsive* when it adapts to the device (viewport) it runs on to offer a specific experience which is adequate to the context.

---

We might forfeit some content for the sake of a clean appearance

The current trend in design is *mobile first.*

The simple `flexbox` option in the CSS make boxes *responsive*


---

## The basic setup: CSS

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

it applies to *all elements*

boxes are forced in their assigned dimension, which thus remain fixed

---

## The basic setup: HTML

```html
<head>
  <meta name = "viewport"
        content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ...
</head>    
```

Thanks to these we can set dimensions as percentages

Fix max (or min) dimension and let the browser adjust the rest

Default: circa 980px, a desktop screen. So on smaller screens everything would look tiny

---

Example: 200 or 250?

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
   border: 5px solid black;
}
```

without `border-box`, it's 250...

. . .

```css
div {
  width: 50%; 
  padding: 20px; 
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

will always take up half of the screen, whatever the padding

---

## Media queries, 1

```css
/* don't normally show these elements */
.quotation {
    display: none;
    padding-right: 1.67%;
}
```

---

## Media queries, 2

On wide screens start showing them:

```css
@media (min-width: 750px) {
    /* ok, it's a big screen: 
       show quotations */
    .quotation {
        display: block;
    }
}
```

## Definitions

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="70%"}
the __size__ of an image is

<no. of pix. rows> x <no. of pix. cols>

Example: look at `./imgs/webcomm-cover.jpg`

The __aspect ratio:__ 

no. of pixel colums : no. of pixel rows
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
![](./imgs/webcomm-cover.jpg)
:::
::::


---

## Activity: image preparation

Resize images

Win: right-click on `wdp-cover.png` to open with `Photos`

- click on ``...`` then ``Resize``

- what is the effect of increasing pixelage?

- and of altering aspect ratio?


---

## Issues with images

scaling an image beyond its original size reveals pixelation and ugly edges

Scaling must be capped and not follow browser resizing.

---

## Making images *fluid*

```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

Expansion is capped to the original dimensions

*shrinkage* not so

## Exercise 14-1

Take 10 minutes to work on [exercise 14-1](https://webdesignplayground.io/lessons/14-1-0)

As soon as you're done think how you can transfer this to your in-class project: is it worth?


---

## Having multiple sizes, 1

May create professional-looking, responsive pages

![](./imgs/14-multiple.png)


---

## Having multiple sizes, 2

![](./imgs/14-multiple.png)

Best for corporate sites with images in a database etc.

Implementation is well-known to be error-prone.

# Typography


---

## Typography: static

![](./imgs/14-fonts-a.png)

What if font sizes change to adapt to viewport size?

---

## Relative units

`rem:` *relative* units of measure

```css
html {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

Now 1rem=20px, 1.5em=30px and so on *for the whole page*

By default, browers set `font-size: 16px;` so 1rem = 16px

Vice versa, `em` is relative to the font size in the specific *container* we're in, not the whole document


---

## Typography: dynamic

![](./imgs/14-fonts-b.png)



---

## Issues, 1

![](./imgs/14-fonts-c.png)

the `header` container is fixed at 64px!

`rem` alone won't do

## A cheatsheet

---

![](./imgs/14-typography-cheatsheet.png)

work on your `mystyle.css` from the COM page to include all setups

bring it with you across projects
