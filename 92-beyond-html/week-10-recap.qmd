# Week 10 Recap

---

## Concepts, a

Pages now are Bootstrap 5

- *responsive* is granted

- the season-example page contains boilerplate code for your project

- carousel is boiler: just supply the local (curated) file names

---

## BS5 classes: how many is too many?

Read the BS5 boilerplates seen in class

1. Define what effect you'd like to have

2. Search BS5 classes on  [getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## A/B testing

- stats that support an evidence-based development

- we save profiles into cookies, but we still need to collect responses centrally

- collecting responses and contacts is central to planning long-term interactions

---

## Useful functions


```js
setCookie(name, value, days)
```

Writes 

```js
'preference'='dark_theme;'
```

---

```js
getCookie(name)
```

reads it the next time


---

```js
changeSeason(season)
```

where `season` is related to specific CSS styles


---

## Basic operation


```js
// On load, restore season from cookie (if any), otherwise default
// notice how function() {...} is used to have a reaction that consist 
// of more than one line of code
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {

  var saved = getCookie('preferred-season');

  // if there is no preference yet expressed, now we fix default
  if (!saved) {
    saved = 'default';
  }

  changeSeason(saved);
});
```
