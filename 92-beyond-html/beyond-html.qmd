## Web pages, today

Writing direct HTML today could actually make you look strange, at least:

![](https://www.aprogrammerlife.com/images/pictuers/i_saw_a_guy_building_a_website_today.jpg)

---

There are increasing levels of adoption of standard *platforms:*

sets of ancillary ``.css`` and ``.js`` files which are included in the page and determine the overall visuals and how the page interacts.

Bootstrap 5 is a platform.


---

1. make your own files, include CSS and javascript

Total creative control

need to learn and practice HTML, CSS and JS.

---

2. Include a Bootstrap 5 template.

Can you follow the [Bootstrap 5 Cheatsheet](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/cheatsheet/)?

---

3. include a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) theme.

Less control but a uniform, smooth appearence.

---

4. include a Javascript *framework*

pages are created by JS functions which  parse cookies and users' moves and select the appropriate elements.

Examples: [Angular (Google)](https://angular.io/), [Webix](https://webix.com/)...

able to collect and send back for analysis the telemetry of user movements, e.g., how long time is dedicated to reading each post.

---

5. work in a programming language to create HTML files dynamically.

Example: the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) module for Python

Create HTML files dynamically, by writing Python functions which return HTML code

Take module `C4CSS: Coding for the Computational Social Sciences (6CFU)` to learn Python.


---

Mixing HTML and Python code in the same file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Hello from Flask</title>
{% if name %}
  <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
{% else %}
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
{% endif %}
```


# Advanced mark-up


---

## Decoration and Injection

Marking-up your text to program its visualisation is *decoration*

Examples: MS Word, HTML5

Whereas HTML5 can be inspected and modified, in MS Word your text is *embedded* into the file


---

## Injection

Adding mark-up commands to your text with software is *injection*

An HTML5 with a side `script.js` is an example of injection.

As G. Orwell would put it: decoration good, injection better!

Today injection is often carried out via [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).


---

## The Pandoc software

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) = all documents.

Peels the decorations out, gives the content to the needed __injector__

On Win, install it via [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pandoc):

```bash
choco install pandoc
```

On Apple, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install pandoc
```


---

## Work with Pandoc

Magic commands to transform files:

```bash
pandoc --from=txt mytext.txt -t html -o mypage.html 
```

```bash
pandoc --standalone --from markdown --to html5 myfile.md -o myoutputfile.hmtl
```

---

more examples [here](https://pandoc.org/demos.html).

Try it into the [online sandbox](https://pandoc.org/try/)!

Example

```bash
> pandoc -t markdown -o out.md .\grantPPA_PaccanaroRuediger-textonlyexample.txt
```

## Presentation vs. Web page

Today this distinction is blurring thanks to Javascript-based presentations that become web pages.

* presentation: synchronous, restricted

* Web page: asynch., universal.

Yet, we see the rise of [manifold pages.](https://pantar.com/the-first/)


# Remarkjs


---

[MD cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Familiarise with the Remarkjs FrameworK

<https://remarkjs.com/#1>

The '#1' is the page/slide number:

<https://my-schematic-remark-presentation.andreamariadt.repl.co/#1>


---

See the source of the [intro slides to Remarkjs](https://remarkjs.com/#1)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <textarea id="source">
      name: inverse
      layout: true
      class: center, middle, inverse
      
      ---

      # remark

      [ri-mahrk]

      .footnote[Go directly to [project site](https://github.com/gnab/remark)]
---
```

Notice non-MD directives, e.g., `class: center, middle`


---

## From MD to slides

Pandoc can generate a HTML file with slides

Use MD annotations with two extra conventions

By default, `#` for section title and `##` for slide title

a slide separator is needed: it redefines the meaning of `---` in MD

Sometimes `-----` is used.

Idea: keep the Markdown in a separated file, keep the HTML and Javascript boilerplate in a general `index.html` file


# Revealjs


---

A project now available as a stand-alone [slides.com](slides.com)

A refined set of Javascript embeddings is available from [the main site](revealjs.com)

Let's focus on [MD embeddings](https://revealjs.com/markdown/)

## What about Powerpoint?

The first release was in 1987 [source: Wikipedia], i.e., well before the *internet revolution.*

For reference, this was fashion in 1987

Today,

1. everything is hyper-linked and hardly any document is self-contained

2. Cross-publishing invariably means changing styles

3. yet, content is often ambivalent synch/asynch

JS-based presentations have the concept of *linking* (and re-processing) at the core.

Powerpoint can only hope to import it in...
