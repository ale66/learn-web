# Bootstrap 5


---

## Today, web pages

- must be responsive (to the display) but `flex` and `@media` are often complicated
  
- are tedious to write, with lots of HTML and CSS: errors ensue

- contain large HTML+CSS boilerplates that should be included automatically

- because of JS, all relevant items of the page have *classnames* and *ids*


---

## New ideas

A new, online CSS and JS 'for all'  

An intermediate *canvas* will support page design 

under the canvas, powerful JS functions take care of resizing etc.

big rectangles, called *containers,* support touch-based navigation

A myriad of small improvements that deploy *hidden* JS functions to traditional HTML components

On balance: bit more HTML ids but much less CSS+JS


---

## The canvas

The visible space is divided into (up to) 12 columns

some columns may be *lumped* together into wider cols.

automatic column re-arrangement in response to screen size

## My first Bootstrap

Crank up VS Code, then make sure you have the [HTML boilerplate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sidthesloth.html5-boilerplate) extension

create a new HTML file, type 'html' and select the HTML5 boilerplate as in fig. below:

![](./imgs/html-boilerplate.jpg)

Follow the step-by-step copy-paste described on [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)


---

## My second Bootstrap

Hands-on intro: study the [Bootstrap 5.2 template](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/trybs_template1.htm)

responsiveness is sorted, mobile is first: think how to deploy BS5 containers to your MA COM project.

The file is available in folder `./src/bs5-template.html`

insert your personal `mystyle.css` as an auxiliary style file: link it *below* the BS5 link

#### More Bootstrap

Test zooming on your smartphone:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Also images are responsive:

```html
<img src = "..." class = "img-responsive" alt = "Responsive image">
```

#### The grid system

*The BS grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page*

*we may group some columns together to create wider columns*

*The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.*

Up to 12 columns

4 breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg)

## Rows are nestable, containers are not

```html
<div class = "container">

   <div class = "row">
      <div class = "col-*-*"></div> 
      
      <!-- .col-xs-N .col-sm-N .col-md-N .col-lg-N -->

      <div class = "col-*-*"></div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "row">...</div>
 
</div>
```

[Study grids](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_grid_examples.php)

try ``<div class="col-sm-4">`` vs. ``<div class="col-xs-4">``.

#### But how does it work?

With BS5 we are *leasing* a visual language from a third-party project

If 1000 users load our page at once, the 1000 copies of the BS5 CSS and Javascript need to be downloaded, apparently from a single source.

Web-scale delivery depends on a complex operation, described [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic).

## The Canvas (advanced)
