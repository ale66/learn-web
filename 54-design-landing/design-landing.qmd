#### The static landing page

*The landing page's job is to explain the product or service and to induce the user to perform some action, such as buy the item, subscribe to the service, or sign up for a newsletter.*

## Lab experiences so far

1. hero image, hero text, then some text, links and the occasional picture

2. landing page, with picture-in-picture and claims, all in the upper part

3. copy styles from the main page: the `unimi.it` page and its 48 CSS files

## Sketch ideas on paper  

Work on a landing for MA COM: it deserves a dedicated one

![](./images/10-sketch.png)

ask a collague to go over the concept: can you explain it?

## Select a color scheme, 2


[Spazio70](https://spazio70.com/il-progetto-spazio70/): punchy but on-topic.

![](./images/10-color-scheme-2.png)

Idea: continue colors seen in an important picture for your thesis, one which is likely to become the *hero picture.*

## The Making of the Hero header, 1

The hero needs work AND plenty of space at the top.

Only captured visitors are going to scroll down if it needs to.

A specific `div` puts the hero image up.

Ok, float this one left

## The Making of the Hero header, 3

## The Footer

Links to social media are *de rigueur*

Find ``.tif`` icons online

![](./images/10-footer.png)


---

The uni logo may go on the footer, preferably on the left: 

```html
<a href="https://www.unimi.it/"><img source="./images/unimi-logo.png"></a>
```
By direct linking:

```html
<a href="https://www.unimi.it/"><img source="https://www.unimi.it/sites/default/files/2019-05/LogoFooter_a9f0c3692bf29c71609e5f204522c5d4_0.png"></a>
```

it is a signature but not as *institutional* as on the upper left
