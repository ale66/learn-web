# Beyond HTML

## Uniform CSSs

So far, each HTML page is a stand-alone, complete page

The CSS files sits in the same folder on your computer

However, the landing page for [unimi.it](view-source:https://www.unimi.it/it) needs 48 CSS files to create its layout and graphics

Each CSS file implement some style of the page.

When there is overlapping, the latest definition *'wins'*

## Complexity

With 150 study programmes x 48 CSS files we are looking at 7200 CSS inclusions!

We will look for a schema CSS that will control *both* 

- the style aspects, color, fonts etc., and 
  
- the structure of the page: images, boxes, adaption to device

The CSS schema is best linked from the web so it will be available everywhere in the project

The 48 CSS styles are on the `unimi.it` server

Yet they are accessible from outside, as browsers need to donwload the CSS into our computer

Look at line 20:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" 
      media="all" 
      href="/core/assets/vendor/jquery.ui/themes/base/core.css?sli9ct"/>
```

but the URL really means

```html
https://www.unimi.it/core/assets/vendor/jquery.ui/themes/base/core.css?sli9ct
```

by *fixing* the initial part of the link we can in fact import available CSS, as we did with the CSS Zen Garden

```html
<base href="https://www.unimi.it/" target="_blank">
```

- Open VS, make sure the HTML boilerplate extension is there

- create a new HTML file, save it in a *working folder* that is easy for your to reach
  
- start typing `html5-boilerplate` to import the baseline HTML code

- remove the comments (text in green)

- to the `head` section, add the `base` command to import the unimi.it CSS files (which URL shall we use?)


---

- go to [com.cdl.unimi.it/en](https://com.cdl.unimi.it/en)

- `CTRL+u` to see the HTML source code 

- copy from the `body` of the page lines 81 to 401 an paste them in the body of your page

- check the preview or the Chromium rendering to adjust

- next, start moving text from your project to your 'fake unimi' page to see how it renders: your 'hero' title should go to `hero-title` and so on

While the unimi landing page is correct, the indexing of the tags is wrong

To read the page and understand what is needed, look at the [com_landing_beautified.html](./com_landing_beautified.html) 

*beautyfied* by hand after using [codebeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer#)
