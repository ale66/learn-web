# Structural tags


---

## Hierarchical

Titles are rendered with the simple ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>`` tags.

The now-obsolete ``<hr>`` divides text without a title.


## Lists

Several styles for lists are available, try toggling ``ul`` for ``ol``

```html
<ol>
  <li>first item</li>

  <li>second item</li>
</ol>
```

Please see again [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp) for the details


## Panels, e.g. for navigation 

See p. 67 of the textbook: we use special styles and ``div`` or ``span`` to achieve eye-catching



# Screen-oriented structure


---

Unless most paper pages (books, magazines etc.), web pages might have a *variable layout* with different contents and styles

Specific layout tags will help us style the sections independently
