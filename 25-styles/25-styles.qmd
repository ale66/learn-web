# Styles


---

## The digital page, so far

- no fixed dimension
  
- light or no table of contents/hierarchy

- basic tags control appearance

- tag names and their effects are part of the HTML5 industrial standard 

- minor variations on how browsers render HTML formatting.


---

## Style personalization

inside each tag we can re-assign some style measures, e.g., colour:

```html
<tag style="attribute:value;">my text</tag>
```

Both ``attribute`` and ``value`` must be selected from a list of admitted names/values.

Mind the syntax: ``style``, ``=``, ``""``, ``:`` and ``;`` are all indespensible.

---

## Examples

```html
<strong style="color: red;">Lorem Ipsum<strong>
```

- try it on your project

```html
<strong style="color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Lorem Ipsum</strong>
```

(check fonts weights on [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight))

---

but what about

```html
<b>L</b>orem ipsum <strong style="color: red;">dolor</strong> sit amet, consectetur 
```

<b>L</b>orem ipsum <strong style="color: red;">dolor</strong> sit amet, consectetur 

- cacophonic visual effects

- the source quickly becomes unreadable

- hard to make global changes (e.g., all instances of *dolor* now become green)

## A special operation

```html
<div style=”text-indent: 16px;”>
```


# The CSS standard

## Idea

- redefine tags with our styles

- create new tags to attach specific styles to text

- __keep webpage styles separated from content__

--

## The engineering of styles

- styles change seldom, mostly through large *facelifting* operations, graphics experts work on them

- contents may change by the minute and are produced by a variety of actors (journalists)

- to keep consistency across large web sites and re-use styles, two or more CSS files could be applied to one page

---

## Get started

from VS Code create a new CSS file, e.g., ``mystyle.css`` and save it alongside your Lorem ipsum page

write on it: 

  ```css
  p {
      text-indent: 20px;
      text-align: justify;
      letter-spacing: 3px;
    }

  span {
        background-color: yellow;
      } 
  ```

Notice the different syntax

Use the embedded code selector, but with *restraint*

---

Now, on the HTML file put at the beginning, e.g., 

```html
  <link href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```  

reload to see how the browser applies the definitions from ``mystyle.css`` to the tags in, e.g., ``lorem.html``

---


## Change the mood, all at once

```css
body {
	font: 11px georgia, serif;
	text-align: center;
	color: #fff;
	background: #748A9B;
	margin: 0px;
	}
```

Put this, the least-specific definition, as first in the CSS file


---

This should be the default

```css
h1, h2 {
        text-align: center;
        }
```

```css
h1 {
    color: purple;
    }
```


# CSS in action
